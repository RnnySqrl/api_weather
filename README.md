# api_weather
To run  the API service you must have installed Python3. 
Also the libraries that I've used: flask and requests
when you have installed go to a console and put in the directory where our code is.
Then run "export FLASK_APP=api_weather.py"
and last "flask run".
If all goes as expected you have the API service running ready to use.
